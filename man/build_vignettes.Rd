\usage{
build_vignettes(pkg = ".", dependencies = "VignetteBuilder", clean = TRUE,
  upgrade = TRUE, quiet = TRUE, install = TRUE, keep_md = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{package description, can be path or package name.  See
\code{\link{as.package}} for more information}

\item{dependencies}{\code{logical} indicating to also install uninstalled
packages which this \code{pkg} depends on/links to/suggests. See
argument \code{dependencies} of \code{\link{install.packages}}.}

\item{clean}{Remove all files generated by the build, even if there
    were copies there before.}

\item{upgrade}{If \code{TRUE}, also upgrade any of out date dependencies.}

\item{quiet}{If \code{TRUE}, suppresses most output. Set to \code{FALSE}
if you need to debug.}

\item{install}{If \code{TRUE}, install the package before building
vignettes.}

\item{keep_md}{If \code{TRUE}, move md intermediates as well as rendered
outputs. Most useful when using the `keep_md` YAML option for Rmarkdown
outputs. See
\link{https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#keeping-markdown}.}

\description{
Builds package vignettes using the same algorithm that \code{R CMD build}
does. This means including non-Sweave vignettes, using makefiles (if
present), and copying over extra files. The files are copied in the 'doc'
directory and an vignette index is created in 'Meta/vignette.rds', as they
would be in a built package. 'doc' and 'Meta' are added to
\code{.Rbuildignore}, so will not be included in the built package. These
files can be checked into version control, so they can be viewed with
\code{browseVignettes()} and \code{vignette()} if the package has been
loaded with \code{load_all()} without needing to re-build them locally.
